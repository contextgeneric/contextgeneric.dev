# Announcement

Weâ€™re excited to announce the release of [v0.3.0](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/releases/tag/v0.3.0) of the [`cgp`](https://docs.rs/cgp/0.3.0/cgp/) crate, along with several [new](https://patterns.contextgeneric.dev/error-handling.html) [chapters](https://patterns.contextgeneric.dev/field-accessors.html) of the [CGP Patterns](https://patterns.contextgeneric.dev/) book!

Read the blog post for more details: [CGP Updates: v0.3.0 Release and New Chapters](/blog/v0-3-0-release/).

# Introduction

Context-generic programming (CGP) is a new programming paradigm for Rust that allows strongly-typed components to be implemented and composed in a modular, generic, and type-safe way.

On this homepage, we provide a quick overview and highlight the key features of CGP. For a deeper dive into the concepts and patterns of CGP, explore our comprehensive book, [Context-Generic Programming Patterns](https://patterns.contextgeneric.dev/).

# Current Status

As of the start of 2025, CGP remains in its _early stages_ of development. While promising, it still has several rough edges, particularly in areas such as documentation, tooling, debugging techniques, community support, and ecosystem maturity.

As such, adopting CGP for serious projects comes with inherent challenges, and users are advised to proceed _at their own risk_. The primary risk is not technical but stems from the limited support available when encountering difficulties in learning or applying CGP.

At this stage, CGP is best suited for early adopters and potential [contributors](/contribution) who are willing to experiment and help shape its future.


# Getting Started

To get started with CGP, the best approach is to dive into our book, [Context-Generic Programming Patterns](https://patterns.contextgeneric.dev/). It provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and working with CGP.

You can also explore real-world applications and projects that use CGP, such as [Hermes SDK](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes-sdk/), to gain a deeper understanding of its practical uses.

Additionally, be sure to check out the [Resources](/resources) page for more materials and learning tools to help you get up to speed with CGP.

# Acknowledgement

CGP was created by [Soares Chen](https://maybevoid.com/), with inspiration drawn from various programming languages and paradigms, particularly Haskell typeclasses.

The development of CGP would not have been possible without the strong support of my employer, [Informal Systems](https://informal.systems/). CGP was initially introduced and refined as part of the [Hermes SDK](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes-sdk/) project, which leverages CGP to build a highly modular relayer for inter-blockchain communication.
