# Contribution

We welcome contributors who are passionate about promoting CGP within the Rust ecosystem. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced Rust developer, there are numerous ways you can contribute to the project.

In this page, we'll explore different ways you can get involved and help grow the CGP community. Your contributions, regardless of your level of expertise, are valuable and appreciated!

## Participate in Discussions

Join the conversation on platforms like [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/Hgk3rCw6pQ), [**GitHub**](https://github.com/orgs/contextgeneric/discussions) or [**Reddit**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cgp/). Whether you have questions about CGP or ideas for new topics or content, these forums are great places to share your thoughts and engage with the community.

## Read The Documentation

We encourage you to explore the documentation available on this website, including the [CGP Patterns](https://patterns.contextgeneric.dev) book. Your feedback is invaluable to us—if you encounter anything confusing or unclear, please let us know so we can improve the content and make it more accessible to everyone.

## Publish Your own CGP Components

The modularity provided by CGP can benefit everyone, even for those who do _not_ care about modularity. An ideal future for CGP is to have a community that publishes large amount of reusable components, that can be used by anyone to build modular applications with minimal application-specific code.

When that happens, it would become possible for CGP to be used by anyone, without having to write their own context-generic code. Instead, the majority of the users will only need to define the wirings of existing components that have been published by the community.

If you _care_ about modularity and would like to contribute, the best way is to start publishing context-generic components, and help build up an ecosystem that benefits the rest of developers.

## Spread on Social Media

Help raise awareness of CGP by sharing it on social media. Follow our official BlueSky account [@contextgeneric.dev](https://bsky.app/profile/contextgeneric.dev) to stay updated on CGP’s development and latest news.

## Write About It

If you find CGP interesting, consider writing your own blog posts or tutorials to share your learning journey. Sharing your insights can help others learn CGP in different ways, and even if the topic is
already covered on the official site, your perspective might make it clearer to others.

## Sponsor Me

If you appreciate my work and want to see CGP gain wider adoption, the best way to support it is to *sponsor* me, regardless of the amount. I have sponsorship pages on [Github Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/soareschen/), [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/maybevoid/about), and [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/maybevoid).

*As with most open-source projects*, I don't expect sponsorship to be enough to allow me to quit my job and work full-time on CGP, or even *with* CGP. *However*, any financial support will significantly boost my confidence in the *value* of my work and encourage me to continue dedicating hundreds of hours of my free time to it instead of other pursuits.

I do hope to eventually spend a year or two working full-time on CGP using my *personal savings*, even if sponsorships don't cover my living expenses. *However*, exponential growth is important, and if I could secure around a quarter of my living expenses through monthly sponsorship, it would reduce some risk and suggest a higher chance of CGP becoming self-sustaining later on.

# Acknowledgement

CGP is created by [Soares Chen](https://maybevoid.com/), with inspiration drawn from various programming languages and paradigms, particularly Haskell typeclasses.

The development of CGP would not have been possible without the strong support of my employer, [Informal Systems](https://informal.systems/). CGP was initially introduced and refined as part of the [Hermes SDK](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes-sdk/) project, which leverages CGP to build a highly modular relayer for inter-blockchain communication.
