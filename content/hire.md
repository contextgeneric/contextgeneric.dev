# Hire Me

## Who Am I

Hello! My name is **Soares Chen**, a.k.a. @MaybeVoid. I a the **creator** of **Context-Generic Programming** (CGP), and I am looking to be **hired** as a **Rust Engineer**. Please check out my [CV](#) and contact me through [my email](soares.chen@maybevoid.com).

My main interest is in programming languages, functional programming, domain-specific languages, and compiler design. But regardless of whether you are hiring for the relevant domains, and whether your company is interested in CGP, please still reach out to me, as I am open to all Rust-related opportunities.

Currently, I am open to all options of hiring - either as a full-time employee, part-time employee, freelance contractor, or as a consultant. I am currently living in Leipzig, Germany, and I mostly only consider remote work options for family options. However, I am open to relocation for rare cases when the compensation and benefits are high enough.

## Status of the CGP Project

For other interested readers who are reading this page, I just want to clarify a bit on what this entails to the CGP project. In particular, I am mostly expecting to be hired as a regular Rust engineer and **not** use CGP at work.

Let's be honest here, no matter how much I promote the technical strengths and advantages of CGP on this website, you are probably still **not** going to try out CGP. And the reason is often simple but non-technical: you want to see CGP getting used in **complex real-world projects** that are **highly successful business-wise**, and you want to see a **large community** with **large companies backing it**, with a large hiring pool available.

Unfortunately, none of these could happen, if I as the **only person** working on the project still have to **pay my bills** and cannot afford to dedicate more than a few months to work on the project. While I would hope to gain funding, contracts, or employment to continue working on CGP to achieve these non-technical goals, I also totally understand that such financial support is likely **not** going to happen, since they would **recursively** require the same pre-conditions that I needed funding to achieve in the first place.

So this is what I would like to ask for your support. If by any chance you are already sold on CGP and would like to use it for your project, that's super awesome and please reach out to me to work together. But even if you are *not* sold on CGP yet, and is merely *impressed* at my Rust skills, please still reach out to me, as I still have to pay my bills regardless of whether I get paid to use CGP at work. All I ask for is your understanding to allow me to continue *slowly* pursuing CGP at my personal free time, *regardless* of whether I will use it professionally at work.
