# Hire Me: Rust Engineer Available

## Who I Am

Hi! ðŸ‘‹  Iâ€™m **Soares Chen** (a.k.a. [@MaybeVoid](#)), the **creator of Context-Generic Programming (CGP)** and a passionate **Rust Engineer**. I'm currently looking for **new opportunities** to contribute to impactful software projects. You can view my [CV](#) and contact me at [soares.chen@maybevoid.com](mailto:soares.chen@maybevoid.com).

My expertise lies in:

* Systems programming with Rust
* Programming languages and compiler design
* Functional programming and type systems
* Domain-specific language (DSL) design

While these are my primary interests, Iâ€™m open to **any Rust-related roles** â€” whether or not they relate to CGP.

Iâ€™m available for:

* Full-time or part-time positions
* Freelance contracts or consulting work

Iâ€™m currently based in Leipzig, Germany. I strongly prefer **remote-first roles** due to family commitments, though Iâ€™m open to relocation in rare cases where the compensation and opportunity justify the move.

## What About CGP?

If youâ€™re wondering whether hiring me means adopting CGP â€” **the answer is no**.

Let me be clear: I am seeking Rust engineering roles where I will **contribute as a pragmatic team member**, building and maintaining high-quality software using industry-standard tools and practices. My work on CGP is a side project and a long-term vision, not a condition of employment.

That said, **CGP demonstrates my ability to solve deep technical problems**, design powerful abstractions, and build tools from the ground up. If that level of initiative and craftsmanship is valuable to your team, we should talk.

Iâ€™m aware that adopting a novel technology like CGP requires trust, traction, and real-world success stories. But ironically, that level of adoption canâ€™t happen unless I can dedicate serious time to the project â€” and I canâ€™t do that without financial stability. So, even if you're **not ready to adopt CGP**, you can still support its future just by **hiring me for regular Rust work**.

## Final Ask

If youâ€™re impressed by CGP, awesome â€” letâ€™s explore working together more deeply.
But even if you're just looking for a **solid Rust engineer** who writes clean, correct, and thoughtful code, Iâ€™m ready to jump in and contribute.

All I ask is the freedom to continue working on CGP in my spare time. Thatâ€™s it.

Thanks for reading â€” and I look forward to hearing from you.

â€” Soares Chen
