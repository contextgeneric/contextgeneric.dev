# Components

A CGP **component** is the bundle that `#[cgp_component]` generates from one trait so that *using* a capability and *implementing* it become separate, swappable things — this is the central reference; read it first.

## What a component is

A component is a single trait definition compiled into a small machine: a **consumer trait** that callers invoke, a **provider trait** that implementations target, a `…Component` marker key, and the blanket impls that connect them. An ordinary Rust trait conflates using a capability with implementing it — the type you call `.area()` on is the same type that supplies the `area` body — and Rust's coherence rules then allow only one implementation per type. A component breaks that conflation, which is what lets many independent implementations of the same capability coexist and lets you implement a capability for a type you do not own.

The split is produced by `#[cgp_component]`, applied to an ordinary trait. Throughout this file the running examples are the greeting component (`CanGreet` / `Greeter` / `GreetHello`, on a `Person`) and the area component (`CanCalculateArea` / `AreaCalculator` / `RectangleArea`, on a `Rectangle`). Assume `use cgp::prelude::*;` in every snippet; the CGP version is v0.8.0.

## What `#[cgp_component(Greeter)]` generates

Applying the macro to a consumer trait produces five items: the consumer trait, the provider trait, two blanket impls, and the marker struct. Start from the trait, naming the provider trait in the attribute argument:

```rust
#[cgp_component(Greeter)]
pub trait CanGreet {
    fn greet(&self);
}
```

The first item is the **consumer trait**, emitted unchanged. This is the self-style trait callers use (`CanDoX`), so a caller writes `person.greet()` exactly as with any trait:

```rust
pub trait CanGreet {
    fn greet(&self);
}
```

The second item is the **provider trait**, the same interface with `Self` moved out into an explicit leading `Context` type parameter and every `self`/`Self` rewritten to `context`/`Context`. It is named in noun form (`SomethingDoer`, or `…Provider` when no noun fits), and it carries an `IsProviderFor` supertrait that captures the component, the context, and a `Params` tuple of any extra type parameters — `()` when there are none:

```rust
pub trait Greeter<Context>:
    IsProviderFor<GreeterComponent, Context, ()>
{
    fn greet(context: &Context);
}
```

A provider trait is implemented not for the context but for a dedicated zero-sized **provider**
struct — a type-level marker that is never instantiated and carries no runtime value. Because a
provider implements `Greeter<Context>` for *its own* struct over a generic `Context`, the orphan and
overlap rules never bite, so `GreetHello`, `GreetGoodbye`, and any number of further providers for
the same component can all exist at once. See
[bypassing coherence](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp-knowledge-base/blob/main/cgp/concepts/coherence.md)
(online) for why moving `Self` to a parameter is what sidesteps the rules, and
[modularity hierarchy](modularity-hierarchy.md) for the spectrum of how far to take the split.

## How the two traits connect

Two generated blanket impls bridge the consumer and provider sides, and together they make `person.greet()` resolve to a chosen provider without the caller naming it. Read them as the wiring machinery; you never write them.

The first is the **consumer blanket impl**, which says that any context implementing the provider trait *for itself* automatically gets the consumer trait. It forwards `context.greet()` to `Context::greet(self)`:

```rust
impl<Context> CanGreet for Context
where
    Context: Greeter<Context>,
{
    fn greet(&self) {
        Context::greet(self)
    }
}
```

The second is the **provider blanket impl**, which lets any provider that delegates this component inherit the provider trait from whatever it delegates to. The delegation is a type-level table lookup through `DelegateComponent`, keyed on the `GreeterComponent` marker:

```rust
impl<Context, Provider> Greeter<Context> for Provider
where
    Provider: DelegateComponent<GreeterComponent>
        + IsProviderFor<GreeterComponent, Context, ()>,
    Provider::Delegate: Greeter<Context>,
{
    fn greet(context: &Context) {
        Provider::Delegate::greet(context)
    }
}
```

The fifth item is the **component marker**, a zero-sized key into those delegation tables:

```rust
pub struct GreeterComponent;
```

These two examples use readable names for clarity; the emitted code uses reserved identifiers — `__Context__` for the context parameter (overridable) and `__Provider__` for the provider parameter — chosen so they never clash with a user's own type names.

## Wiring is the table lookup that ties it all together

**Wiring** is the step that supplies the delegation the provider blanket impl reads, by making a context into a type-level table whose entry for each component names the chosen provider. With the greeting component wired, the chain resolves end to end: `person.greet()` goes through the consumer impl to `Person` implementing the provider trait for itself, which goes through the provider impl to the table entry, landing on the selected provider's `greet`. Swapping the table entry is the only change needed to swap behavior; no caller is touched.

```rust
#[derive(HasField)]
pub struct Person {
    pub name: String,
}

delegate_components! {
    Person {
        GreeterComponent: GreetHello,
    }
}
```

The full table grammar — including per-value dispatch and presets — lives in [wiring](wiring.md). This file shows only the single-entry form needed to make the resolution concrete.

## Why `IsProviderFor` exists

`IsProviderFor` is an empty marker trait that rides along on every provider trait as a supertrait, and its only job is to make a missing dependency produce a readable error. A provider lists what it needs from the context in a `where` clause; when that clause is unmet, the bare question "does this provider implement the provider trait?" yields only "trait not implemented", because the provider blanket impl is also a candidate and Rust suppresses its detailed reasoning whenever more than one impl could apply.

`IsProviderFor` is the second, independent path that un-hides the real reason. The macros implement it for a provider under *exactly the same* `where` bounds as the provider trait, and because that impl is the only candidate (no competing blanket), Rust commits to it and prints the precise unsatisfied constraint. The practical translation a reader needs: an `IsProviderFor` not implemented error means the provider trait is not implemented, and the named bound is the missing dependency. The trait is generated and consumed entirely by the macros — you observe it in errors, you never write it.

```rust
#[diagnostic::on_unimplemented(
    note = "You need to add `#[cgp_provider({Component})]` on the impl block for CGP provider traits"
)]
pub trait IsProviderFor<Component, Context, Params: ?Sized = ()> {}
```

## Writing providers

A provider can be written at three levels of sugar over the same machinery, and `#[cgp_impl]` is the one to reach for. The lower forms exist for when the native provider-trait shape is wanted explicitly, and they are what `#[cgp_impl]` desugars to.

The lowest form is `#[cgp_provider]`, applied to a provider-trait impl written directly on a provider struct. It passes the impl through unchanged and auto-generates the matching `IsProviderFor` impl from the same `where` clause, so the dependency set can never drift. The provider struct must already exist:

```rust
pub struct RectangleArea;

#[cgp_provider]
impl<Context> AreaCalculator<Context> for RectangleArea
where
    Context: HasDimensions,
{
    fn area(context: &Context) -> f64 {
        context.width() * context.height()
    }
}
```

That expands to the impl above plus the empty marker impl carrying the same bound, which is what surfaces a missing `HasDimensions` as a named error:

```rust
impl<Context> IsProviderFor<AreaCalculatorComponent, Context, ()> for RectangleArea
where
    Context: HasDimensions,
{}
```

The optional attribute argument overrides the component type, defaulting otherwise to the provider trait's name plus a `Component` suffix; pass it explicitly only when the trait name does not follow that convention.

The middle form is `#[cgp_new_provider]`, identical to `#[cgp_provider]` but it also declares the provider struct, folding `pub struct RectangleArea;` into the same block. Use it when introducing a fresh provider so you need not write the struct separately; a generic provider yields a struct with a `PhantomData` field over its parameters.

The preferred form is `#[cgp_impl]`, which lets you write the provider in **consumer-style syntax** — keeping `self`, `Self`, and the consumer trait's method signatures — and mechanically rewrites it into the provider-trait shape. The provider name moves into the attribute argument instead of the `Self` position; a leading `new` keyword declares the struct; and you may omit `for Context` entirely, letting the macro insert the context parameter for you:

```rust
#[cgp_impl(new RectangleArea)]
impl AreaCalculator
where
    Self: HasDimensions,
{
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        self.width() * self.height()
    }
}
```

The one rule this convenience must not let you forget: inside a `#[cgp_impl]` block, `self` and `Self` mean the **context**, never the provider struct. The provider has no runtime value, so the macro rewrites every `self` to the context value and every `Self` to the context type — those are the only things that exist when the method runs.

`#[cgp_impl]` desugars to `#[cgp_provider]` (or `#[cgp_new_provider]` when `new` is given). The block above is equivalent to writing the context out by hand and lowering it:

```rust
#[cgp_new_provider]
impl<__Context__> AreaCalculator<__Context__> for RectangleArea
where
    __Context__: HasDimensions,
{
    fn area(__context__: &__Context__) -> f64 {
        __context__.width() * __context__.height()
    }
}
```

The receiver `&self` became `__context__: &__Context__` — the receiver identifier is the snake-cased context name wrapped in double underscores — and `Self` in the `where` clause became the context type. When you write `for Context` explicitly, that name is used instead of `__Context__`, which is worth doing when you need to bound or refer to the context readably.

## Impl-side dependencies

A provider states what it needs from the context as bounds in its `where` clause, and those bounds —
**impl-side dependencies** — are constraints the consumer trait never exposes. `CanCalculateArea`
declares only `area`, while `RectangleArea` requires `Context: HasDimensions`; a caller bounding on
`CanCalculateArea` never sees `HasDimensions`, so the requirement stays one level down and does not
cascade through transitive callers. This is dependency injection through the `where` clause: any
context satisfying the bound gains the capability automatically, and the wiring satisfies each bound
by resolving it through the same context. See
[impl-side dependencies](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp-knowledge-base/blob/main/cgp/concepts/impl-side-dependencies.md)
(online) for the full treatment, and [functions and getters](functions-and-getters.md) for the
value-injection forms (`#[implicit]` arguments and getters) that read fields off the context through
the same mechanism.

## Which items belong in one component

**A component trait may declare as many items as any Rust trait — the question is not how many, but how
many independent *choices* they represent.** Everything in one component is answered by one provider, so
group the items a single provider choice decides together and separate the ones different choices decide.
Most application capabilities are one decision and therefore one method, which is why single-method
components dominate; the count follows from the principle rather than being a limit.

Two groupings of several items are right rather than merely allowed. **A method plus the associated type it
produces**: a provider that answers *how* also answers *what comes back*, which is why CGP's own
`CanCompute`, `CanHandle`, and `CanProduce` each declare `type Output` beside their method, and why a
`CanQueryDatabase` with `type Row` and `query` is good design — splitting `Row` out would let a context
pair the Postgres querier with the SQLite row type. **A getter component grouping several field reads**: a
getter is answered by its own method name rather than by a strategy, so one `UseFields` provider satisfies
every method at once, and there is nothing to split. The trade-off there is that `UseField` and
`WithProvider` are emitted only for a single-method getter trait, so a getter wired to a differently named
field needs its own component.

Grouping items that answer to *different* choices costs three things, and the cost rises with how unrelated
they are rather than with the count. Every provider carries the **union of its methods' dependencies**, so
a capability one method needs is imposed on all of them and on every context wiring that provider. A
[higher-order provider](higher-order-providers.md) must **implement every item**, forwarding the ones it
has no opinion about — a single-decision component wraps in four lines, while a wrapper over an entity
trait is mostly passthrough that grows with every method added. And a context or provider needing part of
the surface must **still answer all of it**, which in practice means placeholder associated types and
`unimplemented!()` bodies, most often in mock contexts written for tests.

Two checks catch a component that has grown past one decision. A consumer trait named after a noun rather
than a verb usually holds several. And if no provider for the trait could ever be reused *whole* by a
second context, the machinery is not paying for itself — implement the trait directly on the concrete
context instead, per the section below. To break one up, split along the axis on which the contexts you
actually want differ: the methods whose dependencies are shared across those contexts become components
with reusable providers, and the ones that must differ get a direct impl on each context. The full
procedure and its costs are in
[sizing a component](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp-knowledge-base/blob/main/cgp/guides/sizing-a-component.md)
(online).

## A consumer trait is still an ordinary trait

A consumer trait can also be implemented directly on a context, exactly like a vanilla Rust trait, when code reuse across providers is not the goal. The consumer/provider split is a superset of ordinary traits, not a replacement: the provider machinery is what you opt into when a capability needs more than one implementation, and skipping it costs nothing for the simple case. You write `impl CanGreet for Person { ... }` as usual, and `person.greet()` resolves to that direct impl with no wiring involved.
