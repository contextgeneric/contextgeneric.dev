# Higher-order providers

How one provider takes another provider as a generic parameter and builds on whatever that inner provider computes — the type-level counterpart to passing a function to a function.

A higher-order provider is a [provider](components.md) parameterized by another provider, so part of its behavior is supplied by an inner provider it delegates to rather than fixed in its own code. The motivating shape is a wrapper that transforms the output of an existing implementation: a `ScaledArea<InnerCalculator>` that multiplies whatever area an inner calculator produces, an `IterSumArea<InnerCalculator>` that sums the areas an inner calculator returns over a collection, a `GloballyScaledArea` that applies a context-wide factor on top of a base calculation. In each case the outer provider knows the *transformation* but not the *base case* — the base case is a parameter. Because a provider carries no runtime value (it is a zero-sized marker naming an implementation), nesting providers costs nothing: the composition happens entirely in types. Assume `use cgp::prelude::*;` throughout; the CGP version is v0.8.0.

## The shape, and the stray `<Self>`

A higher-order provider is written like any other provider with `#[cgp_impl]`, with the inner provider declared as a generic parameter in the provider's `Self` position and bound to a *provider trait* in the `where` clause. The detail that makes it look stranger than it is the extra `<Self>` on that inner bound. Recall that a [provider trait](components.md) moves the consumer trait's `Self` into an explicit leading `Context` parameter — `AreaCalculator<Context>`, not the consumer trait's `CanCalculateArea`. So when the outer provider depends on its inner provider, the bound must name that context argument explicitly:

```rust
#[cgp_impl(new ScaledArea<InnerCalculator>)]
impl<InnerCalculator> AreaCalculator
where
    InnerCalculator: AreaCalculator<Self>,
{
    fn area(&self, #[implicit] scale_factor: f64) -> f64 {
        InnerCalculator::area(self) * scale_factor * scale_factor
    }
}
```

The `<Self>` in `InnerCalculator: AreaCalculator<Self>` is exactly that leading context slot, filled with the context the outer provider is implementing for. Inside `#[cgp_impl]`, `self`/`Self` mean the *context*, so `<Self>` is the context type. The same asymmetry shows at the call site: the inner provider is invoked as the associated function `InnerCalculator::area(self)`, not as a method `self.area()`, because the provider trait's method takes the context as an explicit first argument. A reader who thinks of a provider as "just the consumer trait implemented elsewhere" is caught off guard by both the bound and the call.

## Hiding the friction with `#[use_provider]`

The `#[use_provider]` attribute exists to erase the bound surprise, and is the idiomatic way to write higher-order providers — always reach for it, since it preserves the illusion that a provider trait has the same shape as the consumer trait it came from. Written alongside `#[cgp_impl]`, it takes the inner bound *without* the context argument and fills the `<Self>` back in for you:

```rust
#[cgp_impl(new ScaledArea<InnerCalculator>)]
#[use_provider(InnerCalculator: AreaCalculator)]
impl<InnerCalculator> AreaCalculator {
    fn area(&self, #[implicit] scale_factor: f64) -> f64 {
        let base_area = InnerCalculator::area(self);
        base_area * scale_factor * scale_factor
    }
}
```

The author writes `InnerCalculator: AreaCalculator` and the macro inserts the context type at index 0 of the trait's generic arguments, emitting `InnerCalculator: AreaCalculator<Self>` into the `where` clause — the two snippets above are equivalent. The shape it parses is `Provider: Trait`: a provider type, a colon, and one or more provider-trait bounds joined by `+`; the trait may carry further generic arguments after the context slot, preserved in order behind the inserted `Self`. To bind several inner providers, write **one attribute per provider**:

```rust
#[use_provider(A: AreaCalculator)]
#[use_provider(P: PerimeterCalculator)]
```

Stacking is the intended form here rather than a fallback, because a comma-separated list of pairs does *not* parse — after the first trait the parser is continuing that provider's bound list, so `#[use_provider(A: TraitA, B: TraitB)]` fails with `expected +`. What the `+` does join is several trait bounds on *one* provider: `#[use_provider(Inner: AreaCalculator + PerimeterCalculator)]`. This makes `#[use_provider]` the exception to the one-attribute-comma-separated convention that `#[uses]` and `#[use_type]` follow, so the habit transfers wrongly. The same attribute works on `#[cgp_fn]`.

What `#[use_provider]` does *not* do is rewrite the body. It completes the bound only; the inner provider is still invoked as the associated function `InnerCalculator::area(self)`, with `self` passed as the explicit context. There is no call-site form — a bare `#[use_provider(InnerCalculator)]` on an expression is not accepted, and no pass turns `receiver.method(args)` into `Provider::method(receiver, args)`. The body must spell the associated-function call out itself. Calling the inner provider as a method (`self.area()`) would instead route through whatever provider the context has wired for the component, a different dispatch and usually not what a higher-order provider wants.

## `UseContext` as a default inner provider

A higher-order provider can default its inner provider to [`UseContext`](wiring.md) so that, absent an explicit choice, it falls back to whatever the context itself is already wired to. This requires giving the provider an explicit struct definition with a default generic parameter:

```rust
pub struct IterSumArea<InnerCalculator = UseContext>(pub PhantomData<InnerCalculator>);
```

`UseContext` is the provider that implements any provider trait by deferring to the context's own consumer-trait implementation — the dual of the consumer blanket impl. With `IterSumArea<UseContext>` as the default, an unparameterized `IterSumArea` computes each inner element through the context's existing area wiring, so the wrapper drops in without restating the base case. Overriding the parameter — `IterSumArea<RectangleArea>` — instead binds the inner behavior statically, bypassing the context's wiring, which is useful for overriding or short-circuiting what the context would otherwise resolve. This default exists *only* when the provider has an explicit struct carrying the default parameter; a provider defined purely through `#[cgp_impl(new ...)]` has no default and must always have its inner provider named.

## Not every generic provider is higher-order

A provider that merely has generic parameters is not a higher-order provider; it becomes one only when a parameter is constrained to implement a provider trait. Many providers are generic for unrelated reasons. The `UseField`-style getter provider is generic over a field tag:

```rust
#[cgp_impl(new GetName<Tag>)]
impl<Tag> NameGetter
where
    Self: HasField<Tag, Value = String>,
{
    fn name(&self) -> &str {
        self.get_field(PhantomData)
    }
}
```

Here `Tag` is a type-level field name used only as a `HasField` key, with no provider-trait bound — so `GetName<Tag>` is an ordinary parameterized provider, not a higher-order one. The defining trait of a higher-order provider is that a generic parameter appears in a *provider-trait* bound and is invoked to do part of the work, as `InnerCalculator: AreaCalculator<Self>` does. When that bound is absent, `#[use_provider]` has nothing to fill in and none of the machinery applies.

## Generic-parameter CGP traits

A component's trait may itself carry generic parameters, and `#[cgp_component]` appends them after the context slot. Declaring the area component to dispatch on a `Shape`:

```rust
#[cgp_component(AreaCalculator)]
pub trait CanCalculateArea<Shape> {
    fn area(&self, shape: &Shape) -> f64;
}
```

generates the provider trait `AreaCalculator<Context, Shape>` — the original trait's parameters land *after* the leading `Context`, in declaration order. The `IsProviderFor` supertrait that every provider trait carries groups all those extra parameters into a single tuple in its `Params` slot (`()` when there are none), and any lifetime parameters are lifted into the `Life<'a>` type rather than appearing as bare lifetimes. A provider then writes `impl<Context> AreaCalculator<Context, Rectangle> for RectangleArea`, naming the concrete `Shape` it handles.

## Dispatching on a generic parameter with `open`

When the right provider depends on *which* concrete type a generic parameter is — `Rectangle` handled by one provider, `Circle` by another — the choice is made by a second lookup keyed on that parameter rather than on the component marker. The modern way a context writes this per-type dispatch is the `open` statement of `delegate_components!`, which folds the per-value entries directly into the context's own table. Given a `CanCalculateArea<Shape>` consumer trait whose `Shape` parameter selects the area formula, a context opens the component and then assigns a provider per shape:

```rust
delegate_components! {
    MyApp {
        open AreaCalculatorComponent;

        @AreaCalculatorComponent.Rectangle: RectangleArea,
        @AreaCalculatorComponent.Circle: CircleArea,
    }
}
```

The leading `open AreaCalculatorComponent;` header opens the component for per-value wiring, and each `@AreaCalculatorComponent.Key: Provider` entry assigns a provider for one value of the dispatch parameter: when `Shape` is `Rectangle`, `MyApp` calculates area through `RectangleArea`, and `Circle` resolves to `CircleArea`. After this wiring, `MyApp` implements `CanCalculateArea<Rectangle>` through `RectangleArea` and `CanCalculateArea<Circle>` through `CircleArea`, with the dispatch parameter selecting between them. Adding a shape is one more entry; the providers stay untouched. The `open` form needs no extra macro on the component — it rides the `RedirectLookup` impl that every `#[cgp_component]` already generates, so dispatching a component per type requires no `#[derive_delegate]` on the trait. Two shorthands keep the entries compact: an array on the final path segment shares one provider across several values (`@AreaCalculatorComponent.[Rectangle, Circle]: SomeProvider`), and generic parameters precede the dispatch value when it needs them (`@AreaCalculatorComponent.<'a, T> &'a T: SomeProvider`). The [wiring](wiring.md) reference is the canonical home of the `open` statement and its grammar.

### Legacy: `derive_delegate` and `UseDelegate` nested tables

An older form generates a `UseDelegate<Components>` provider and wires the per-type entries into a separate table it points at. The `#[derive_delegate(...)]` attribute asks `#[cgp_component]` to generate that provider:

```rust
#[cgp_component(AreaCalculator)]
#[derive_delegate(UseDelegate<Shape>)]
pub trait CanCalculateArea<Shape> {
    fn area(&self, shape: &Shape) -> f64;
}
```

`UseDelegate<Components>` is a zero-sized provider that treats its `Components` type as a type-level table — a `DelegateComponent` table keyed on the named parameter (`Shape`) — and forwards each method to the delegate that table maps the concrete type to. A context wires it through a nested table inside `delegate_components!`, building the outer entry and the inner lookup in one place:

```rust
delegate_components! {
    MyApp {
        AreaCalculatorComponent:
            UseDelegate<new AreaCalculatorComponents {
                Rectangle: RectangleArea,
                Circle: CircleArea,
            }>,
    }
}
```

This reads in two layers: `MyApp` delegates `AreaCalculatorComponent` to `UseDelegate<AreaCalculatorComponents>`, and the inner table — defined inline by `new` — maps `Rectangle` to `RectangleArea` and `Circle` to `CircleArea`. The end effect matches the `open` example above, but the dispatch values live in a named side table reached through `UseDelegate` instead of in `MyApp`'s table directly. This is a legacy dispatch mechanism, retained for compatibility and expected to be deprecated; prefer `open` for new code, but expect to still encounter the `derive_delegate`/`UseDelegate` form when reading existing wiring (see [wiring](wiring.md) for both forms side by side).

A component may dispatch on more than one parameter by stacking several `#[derive_delegate(...)]` attributes, one per dispatcher. Writing `#[derive_delegate(UseDelegate<Code>)]` and `#[derive_delegate(UseInputDelegate<Input>)]` generates one impl per dispatcher — the default `UseDelegate` keying on `Code`, plus a user-defined `UseInputDelegate<Components>` (an ordinary struct of the same single-parameter shape) keying on `Input` — so each parameter is looked up through its own table. Only the parameter named in a dispatcher's angle brackets is used as the key; the others flow through. Per-type dispatch and higher-order providers compose either way: an `open` entry or a nested delegation table can map each shape to a different `ScaledArea<...>`.

## Cross-context dependencies through a shared context

The real leverage of generic-parameter dispatch appears when the main target of a capability is itself a generic parameter, and a supertrait constrains the *context* rather than each parameter type. Consider an area component whose result type is an abstract scalar the context supplies:

```rust
#[cgp_component(AreaCalculator)]
#[use_type(HasScalarType.Scalar)]
pub trait CanCalculateAreaOfShape<Shape> {
    fn area_of_shape(&self, shape: &Shape) -> Scalar;
}
```

Because the shared capability — `HasScalarType` and any value-level injection — lives on the common context, the individual shape types (`Rectangle`, `Circle`) need not implement it themselves; they only know their own geometry. The context provides the shared abstract type ([abstract types](abstract-types.md)): one app might wire `Scalar` to `f64`, another to a fixed-point type, and every shape provider produces that scalar. The context also provides value-level injection — a `GloballyScaledArea` provider can read a global scale factor from a field on the context through an implicit argument and multiply every shape's area by it, so the scale is configured once per context rather than per shape. Most importantly, provider binding is *lazy and per-context*: a `BaseApp` and a `ScaledApp` can wire the very same `Shape` to different providers — `BaseApp` opening `AreaOfShapeCalculatorComponent` and mapping `@AreaOfShapeCalculatorComponent.Rectangle: RectangleArea` to a plain `RectangleArea`, `ScaledApp` mapping `@AreaOfShapeCalculatorComponent.Rectangle: GloballyScaledArea<RectangleArea>` instead — so the same generic capability resolves to different behavior in each context without either app's shapes knowing about the other. Each context writes its per-shape choices with the `open` statement detailed in [wiring](wiring.md); the legacy `derive_delegate`/`UseDelegate` nested-table form wires the same dispatch and still appears in existing code. Each layer of such nesting can be verified independently with the `#[check_providers]` form of `check_components!`, which is what makes higher-order wiring debuggable; see [checking](checking.md).

## Related constructs

Higher-order providers build on the consumer/provider split and the `IsProviderFor` propagation described in [components](components.md), and they are connected to contexts through [wiring](wiring.md), where `UseContext`, the `open` statement, and the legacy nested-table `UseDelegate` forms all live. `UseContext` lets the inner provider fall back to the context's own consumer-trait impl; the `open` statement dispatches a component on a generic parameter by folding per-value entries into the context's own table, with the legacy `UseDelegate` provider (generated by the `derive_delegate` option) doing the same through a separate side table; the abstract result types that make cross-context dependencies work are covered in [abstract types](abstract-types.md) and the type-level keys in [type-level primitives](type-level-primitives.md). Each layer of a nested provider is checked independently through [checking](checking.md).
